# DENTAL ART CLINIC LIMASSOL Website — Design Description

## Overall Description

The website is for **DENTAL ART CLINIC LIMASSOL**, founded by Dr. Maria Charalambous-Ivanova, DMD, MSD. The theme is predominantly **purple with gradients** (from light purple to white), soft pink accents, floral-like icons (e.g., starburst shapes), and modern, rounded UI elements.

The website focuses on scientifically precise dental care with specialization in composite veneers and Emax veneers, as well as complex full mouth rehabilitation cases. The layout is presented as a vertical scroll of the entire landing page, showing sections from top to bottom.

Images of professional dental work and the clinic environment are integrated throughout for a sophisticated feel. The design is responsive, with a clean sans-serif font, ample white space, and call-to-action buttons in purple.

The page uses a light purple background with subtle gradients and overlays. Navigation is horizontal at the top, content is centered or grid-based, and sections alternate between full-width hero areas and card/grid layouts. The site presents content in three languages: Greek, English, and Russian.
